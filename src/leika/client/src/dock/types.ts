// Data model for the docking library.
//
// The layout is intentionally serializable: it holds only ids, geometry, and
// structure -- never React nodes. Panel *content* lives in a separate registry
// (see PanelRegistry) keyed by panel id, so the same layout can be saved,
// restored, or driven from the server later without touching the render tree.
//
// Vocabulary:
// - Panel: a single titled pane of content. The atomic unit.
// - TabGroup: one or more panels shown as tabs in a shared frame. A group with
//   a single panel is just a plain panel (we hide the tab strip in that case).
// - DockNode: a binary/n-ary split tree describing the docked region on one
//   screen edge. Leaves point at a TabGroup; splits arrange children in a row
//   (side by side) or column (stacked) with per-child flex weights.
// - FloatingWindow: a free-positioned container holding a vertical stack of
//   TabGroups (a "snap group"). A stack of one is a normal floating panel.
